## Getting Started

You will be unable to run this code without the correct env variables.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
If this does not work then you will probably need to do an install:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```



Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
