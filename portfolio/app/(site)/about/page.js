                    <p>
                        I am an energetic and experienced IT professional.  For all of my career, I have been connected
                    with the technology sector. I have had a somewhat eclectic pathway, pursuing a number of different
                    avenues, including some entrepreneurial ventures stemming from some of my passion projects.

                    <p className="pt-8">
                        The common thread throughout all positions I have held in my career, all across the world,
                        is an unrelenting pursuit of excellence, innovation and dedication to outstanding customer
                        service or problem solving.  Whether in my capacity as entrepreneur, enterprise architect,
                        analyst, consultant or otherwise, I have a demonstrated track record of using different
                        techniques, technologies, methodologies, and processes to achieve a deep understanding of
                        the customerâ€™s business, challenges, and opportunities.  Done properly, once that deep
                        knowledge gathering exercise has occurred, it builds trust, rapport, and credibility with
                        the customer, to allow the team to deliver value to the customer.
                    </p>
                    <p className="pt-8">
                        Like many, throughout my career, I have had the great fortune of working with excellent
                        colleagues and for excellent organizations.  I have also worked for organizations that
                        were still finding their niche of excellence.  All of these opportunities have taught me
                        many things; about leadership, mentorship, and adaptability.
